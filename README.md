# Programming-Languages Paper Template

This is a template repo for writing papers in programming languages. 
It contains the directory structure, Makefile, and bibliography that I use when writing papers.
Ideally, this makes the process of getting started with writing a paper easier, and makes it easier to keep everything organized. 

## Organization
The directory structure of this template is as follows:
- Root
  + Makefile
  + README.md
  + .gitignore
  + .latexrc
  + paper
     - paper.tex
	 - sections.tex
	 - intro.tex
	 - conclusion.tex
  + bibliography
     - main.bib
## Latex Tips and Tricks
- Use one sentence per line
